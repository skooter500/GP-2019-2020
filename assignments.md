# Assignment 2

Create a game in Processing inspired by the classic Atari Game Air Sea Battle (also known as Target Fun) first released in 1977. Here is a gameplay video:

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/NJKMUNTChTg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJKMUNTChTg)

What is happening:

There are two turrets, each controlled by a different player. Players can aim the turrets by moving the joystick up and down. There are three angles that turrets can be set to. Players fire at the airplanes and helicopters that move across the screen and the first player to reach the score is the winner of the game. Players can only fire one bullet at a time. 

[Play the game in the browser here!](http://www.free80sarcade.com/2600_Target_Fun.php). Player one uses arrow keys and space to fire. Player 2 uses TG and Q to fire.

There are 27 different variations of the basic game. Try them out in the emulator and read the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-Sea_Battle) for more information.

| First | 2 players with aiming, multiple enemies, several gameplay modes, sound effects, several advanced features of Processing that you taught yourself such as classes. Lots of fun to play. Lots of love |
| 2.1 | 2 players, maybe no aiming, only one gameplay mode, maybe only one enemy at a time, sound effects. Kinda fun for a short while.  Some love |
| 2.2 | One player, maybe no aiming, only one gameplay mode, one enemy at a time. A bit boring. A small bit of love |
| Pass | One player, no aiming, bugs. Not much love | 


# Assignment 1

Create an animated Christmas card in Processing. You must make the Christmas card for someone and give it to that person. 
Here are some examples of previous assignments that students have done:

In your christmas card you should use:

- Procedural drawing (no sprites!)
- Variables
- The if statement
- Loops
- Functions
- Arrays
- Any other cool stuff you have taught yourself in Processing

Rubric:

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Animation, loops, arrays and methods used extensively and correctly. Everything parameterised. Use of audio and fonts. Some complex interactivity such as a game or generative system. Use of keyboard, mouse or controller input. Music and fonts. Use of some advanced features of P5 we havent covered in class such as classes and libraries. 200+ lines of code|
| 2.1 | Lots of animation, loops and arrays. Functions. Also using audio and fonts. Little or no interactivity. Between 100 and 200 lines of code |
| 2.2 | No animation or simple back and forth type animation, use of loops, but no arrays. Some duplicated code that could be replaced by an array or a loop. Some methods, but no parameters instead using global variables (or no methods). Around 100 lines of code|
| Pass | No animation. No loops or arrays, just some simple drawing in the draw method, or some attempt at loops that doesnt work. 20-50 lines of code |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |
